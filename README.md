gitsession.vim
==============

Say goodbye to troublesome session file management.

## About
With this plugin you can save&load session file (the arrangement of tabs&windows) tagged with git repository, its absolute path and its remote repository URL.

## Quick Start
Install it with a plugin manager.

Go into your project, open NeoVim, edit as you like, and run `:SaveSession` before you leave. This will save your current session.

When you are back, run `:LoadSession` in the same project repository. Your window setting will reappear.

## Compatibility
This plugin works with Vim as well, but as I only tested it with NeoVim, compatibility is not guaranteed. If you find any problem, please send Issue/PR.
